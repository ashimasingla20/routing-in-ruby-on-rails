 a route to be able to display pages with different information about different types of beer. The route should recognize URL paths like /beer/<beer_type> and should use the same controller action for each type of beer with the actually beer type passed into the controller action as a parameter. 
The valid beer types are: 
IPA 
brown_ale 
pilsner 
lager 
lambic 
hefeweizen 
Any other type of beer specified should generate a 404 status code.
